          <p> <h2> Institutes </h2> </p>

          <p> Our sample consisted of 150 business schools that are accredited by <a href = "http://www.efmd.org/accreditation-main/equis"> EQUIS </a>,
            the European accreditation association conducting quality assurance of business school,
            and the top 100 most innovative universities according to Reuters.
            The ranking for innovative universities is based on the following <a href="https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-2017/methodology">
              criteria </a>: scientific output,
            technological advances, and progress that stimulate the creation of new markets and industries.
            Our sample of institutions is located in 42 countries. </p>
          <p> <h2> Data Sources </h2>
          </p>
          <p>For each institution, we captured their social media activity between <em>January 1st 2011 and September 7th 2017</em>.
             We focused on content curated by the institutions on <a href="www.twitter.com"> <strong>Twitter</strong> </a> and <a href="www.facebook.com>">
               <strong>Facebook</strong> </a>. In practice this means, the data contains all tweets that institutions created or retweeted,
             and all posts that the institutions posted on their official Facebook page. This excludes students comments, and @ mentions.
             This resulted in a dataset of 975,574 social media posts.
             Due to language and technical issues we focused on posts that were in English and contained no more than 4000 bites,
             between 1024 and 4096 characters. After data cleaning our database contained a total of 652,625 posts, consisting of 386,882 tweets and
             265,743 Facebook posts.
           </p>
          <p>Information about students’ self-reported skills and employment information was gathered using <a href = "www.linkedin.com"> <strong>LinkedIn’s school pages </strong></a>.
            This does not include any personal information. The school's pages provide aggregated information about the
             top self-reported skills and current employers of graduates who have attended the institutes during our selected time period.
           </p>
          <p>With the aim to understand the research and teaching expertise of business school we collected information about vacancies
            from academic institutes. We collaborated with <a href ="www.academictransfer.nl"><strong>Academic Transfer </strong></a>,
            a company publicizing vacancies in the Dutch Academic labor market.
            From their dataset we analyzed vacancies across all scientific disciplines from 2010-2017. We conducted an automatic topic analyzes on the
            vacancies description and requirements
             (<a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/08/22/introduction-to-latent-dirichlet-allocation/"> Latent Dirichlet Analysis </a>).
          </p>
          <p> To gain better insight into the labor market and skill level, we searched for open data sets.
            The European Commission conducts reseach on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/new-report-shows-digital-skills-are-required-all-types-jobs">
            <strong>digital skills</strong> </a>. From this research project, we included the <a href"https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ict-work-digital-skills-workplace"> Digital Skill Survey </a>. Specifically, we added
            survey respondents’ information about their company (size of company, country of HQ, job title) and their estimates about digital skills needed and
            possessed across different job categorize (professionals, managers, sales). In the survey’s code book these questions were Q16_1_1 until Q16_10_5,
             Q23, Q30 until Q33.
             <br>
             Also from the European commission, we included <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=isoc_sk_dskl_i&lang=en">
               Eurostat’s dataset </a> on managers’ perception about digital skill of employees, downloaded via <a href="www.datamarket.com"> datamarket </a>.
               <br>
             From the <a href="www.oecd.org"> OECD </a>, we included results from the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/"><strong>2013 Adult Skill Survey (PIAAC)</strong></a>,
             which provides country information about adult skill, knowledge, and
             work styles. <a href="http://www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/Technical%20Report_Section%201.pdf">The survey assessed literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving in technology rich environments </a>.
             From OECD we also included country specific data about percentage of workers who report structural
             change in their workplace and percentage of workers who report new ways of working in the workplace (1990 – 2009).
             <br>
             From OECD we also included <a href="www.oecd.org/skills/piaac/SkillsOutlook2013_ENG_Table_Chapter1.xlsx">
               two tables with country specific trend data </a> about percentage of workers who report structural change in their workplace and percentage
             of workers who report new ways of working in the workplace (1990 – 2009).
